# TO-Shelter-Analysis
Data project to analyze 2017 Toronto shelter data. Data used is from the City of Toronto's open data portal, specifically the csv file found at https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/health/#711ba031-b32b-3390-ce54-22c15ac6389f . 

This project will be a showcase in data preparation/ cleaning using Pandas, and visualizations. The end product will be a dashboard in which the user can see shelter usage statistics on a time scale of a year.
